# Coder Cards Matching Game

A card matching game made with jQuery, javascript, CSS, and HTMl.
A flip card matching game may sound easy, but just try to keep all 5 thumbs up by keeping the number of moves down, and you will soon see how difficult it can be!

## Getting Started

Open up index.html in your default browser, the timer and moves counter starts on your first click on a card.

There are 5 thumbs in total to begin with, the more moves you take to finish the game, the less thumbs you will finish the game with.

Depending on the number of thumbs you manage to keep up you will receive a special completion message!
